## API

We tend to use the `/api` module to run all our HTTP requests. Made with [Ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky#readme).

## Design System

[Figma](https://www.figma.com)

We want to use the [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#the-atomic-design-methodology) approach. But as we just began this app, the [Page](./src/ds/pages/Page/Page.jsx) component won't follow this approach.
